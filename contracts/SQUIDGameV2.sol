// SQUID Game (SQUID) is originally a meme coin on Binance Smart Chain.
// Old Proxy Contract:  https://bscscan.com/token/0x87230146E138d3F296a9a77e497A2A83012e9Bc5

// Squid Game V2 (SQUID) - OFTV2 Contract deployed on BNB Smart Chain Mainnet to: 0xFAfb7581a65A1f554616Bf780fC8a8aCd2Ab8c9b

// Why is the original SQUID token(BSC address above) migrating on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) to this new OFTV2(LayerZero-powered) contract?
// The migration of the SQUID token to a new, more secure smart contract on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
// is essential for addressing the security risks associated with the current proxy contract.
// This strategic move aims to eliminate vulnerabilities, prevent potential manipulations,
// and ensure alignment with the highest standards of token security.

// SQUID V2 will be an omnichain fungible token (OFT) that conforms to the OFT standard, which enables tokens to work seamlessly across multiple blockchains.
// This means that SQUID V2 holders can access various decentralized exchanges (DEXes), lending platforms,
// and other DeFi services on different chains without needing bridges or wrappers.
// SQUID V2 will leverage LayerZero’s modular security framework,
// which allows developers to choose from different decentralized verifier networks (DVNs) to verify cross-chain messages.
// This ensures that SQUID V2 transactions are secure, reliable, and cost-efficient.
